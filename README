# Star Wars RPG LaTeX Package

This is a LaTeX package for typesetting adventures, custom rule supplements and
any other documents for the Fantasy Flight series of Star Wars roleplaying
games, *Edge of the Empire*, *Age of Rebellion* and *Force and Destiny*. It
currently includes commands for symbols of dice and the success, threat,
triumph, etc. symbols used in the rule system. It also includes a nice
background to give your work a real Star Wars feeling.

## Usage

Include the `swrpg` package. That's it. Optionally call the `\swrpgbackground`
command to add a background image similar to those found in the official
rule books. For further commands, see the `example.tex` file.

## Future goals

 * Add a command to quickly and easily typeset adversaries.

## Credits

Fantasy Flight owns the symbols for dice and any symbols represented on those
dice. The background image included is creditet to user *Admiral Terghon* on the
Fantasy Flight forums.
